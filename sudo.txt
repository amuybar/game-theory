using C programming language

lets write a game theory code that will run up to 5 tries

 it should have two players playerA whose  response while be generated randomly and playerB whose responsewile be given by a function call

 response will either be cooperating or defecting, So playerA response should be random based on those two response,

 playerB response :
  for try 1 to 5 
    try 1 playerB response=cooperating
    try 2 playerB response=cooperating
    try 3 playerB response:
          if playerA response(try 1&&try 2==cooperating)
          then return playerB=cooperating
          else if playerA response(try 1==cooperating&&try 2==defecting)
          then return playerB=cooperating
          else return playerB=defecting
    try 4 playerB response:
         if playerA response(try 1&&try2&&try 3) has more than 2 cooperating then
          return playerB=cooperating

          else return playerB=defecting

    try 5 response:
      playerB response=defecting
